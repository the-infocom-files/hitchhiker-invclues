	  "This time, though, it isn't smell that goes away on the fourth description."
	  "It's hearing."
	  "Try HEAR NOTHING or LISTEN TO DARKNESS."
	  "There is an exit to port. Try going that way."
	  "Be persistent. Try going PORT a few more times."
	  "Perhaps AFT would be more productive, come to think of it.">
	 <LTABLE 3
	  "Exactly how does Dark work?"
	  "You enter Dark when Earth is destroyed, and other times throughout the game."
	  "At the fourth turn in Dark, one of your five senses will disappear."
	  "You should type the sense that no longer appears, such as SMELL or SEE."
	  "The first time, smell will go away. See the first question in this section."
	  "The second time, hearing will go away. See the third question in this section."
	  "On subsequent visits to Dark, the sense that disappears will be fairly random. See the following question for more details.">
	 <LTABLE 3
	  "Can I control my exit from Darkness?"
	  "Not usually."
	  "Don't continue until you have a cup of tea."
	  "Don't continue until you have real tea, not merely Advanced Tea Substitute."
	  "Have you ever examined the cup of tea?"
	  "Tea is a better source of Brownian Motion for the Improbability Drive than the Advanced Tea Substitute (ATS). Try it."
	  "Notice anything different about Dark when you use tea instead of ATS?"
	  "For one thing, a sense is missing right away, rather than after three WAITs."
	  "More importantly, with tea, a different sense will be missing each time you WAIT. Thus, you can \"control Dark.\""
	  "There are eight exits from Dark (taste never goes away), so there are two Dark exits for each missing sense."
	  "There is a way to differentiate between each pair."
	  "For example, when smell disappears, type SMELL DARK. If the object is \"being waved,\" then the exit leads to the Vogon Hold. If the object is \"waving,\" the exit is the Lair of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal."
	  "When hearing is missing: If the sound is \"far above you,\" then your exit is Entry Bay Number Two of the Heart of Gold. If it's \"far below you,\" then it's the War Chamber of the battle fleet."
	  "If seeing is the missing sense: When the light stabs at the \"front\" of your eyes, then your exit is the Country Lane. When it's at the \"back\" of your eyes, then you go onto the Presidential Speedboat."
	  "When feel is missing: If it feels \"cold\" and wet and squishy, the exit is to the Living Room party. When it's \"warm,\" your exit is into the sperm whale."
	  "When you are controlling dark and have determined your current exit, but you don't want to go there, simply WAIT and you will get a new missing sense. NOTE: You will never get the whale exit unless you are using real tea for your Brownian Motion source.">>

	  "Standing or lying in front of the panel won't work."

	  "You want to get \"picked up\" by Phil. However, he won't take any notice of you until you take the fluff and get Arthur talking to you."
	  "In order to take the fluff, though, you'll have to drop something. This will cause the hostess to start hovering around you. Phil is much too smart to approach you when you're with the hostess."
	  "So, to get Phil to come over, you'll have to take the item that the hostess keeps offering you. To do so, you'll have to drop something, and the piece of fluff is the only thing you have that you can drop without setting off the hostess again."
	  "There IS a way to stop holding the fluff WITHOUT dropping it."
	  "Look at what you're carrying again."
	  "You can put the fluff in your handbag."
	  "Naturally, the fluff is still in the handbag when you eventually get back to the Heart of Gold. You need only go to the Bridge or wherever you left the handbag, open it, and take the jacket fluff."
	  "If you're still confused, one sequence of moves that will \"solve\" the party scene is:  EXAMINE ARTHUR. DROP THE WINE. TAKE THE JACKET FLUFF. OPEN THE HANDBAG. PUT THE FLUFF IN THE HANDBAG. TAKE THE WINE. Then just WAIT until Phil comes up and escorts you away. You will end up in Dark.">>

	  "Also, see the question about the screening door in the HEART OF GOLD section.">
	 <LTABLE 3
	  "What is the thing my aunt gave me?"
	  "Have you tried examining it?"
	  "Have you tried getting rid of it?"
	  "You've probably noticed that it keeps turning up."
	  "If you leave it behind, it will pop up about a dozen moves later, sometimes on the ground where you are, sometimes in your inventory, and sometimes in your gown pocket. (The thing will only \"follow\" you when you are Arthur.)"
	  "There's something else that you probably haven't noticed about the thing your aunt gave you."
	  "You can put things in it. In fact, you can put almost every takeable item into the thing at the same time."
	  "This is useful for transporting more objects than you can carry, but it isn't ever necessary to do so."
	  "Because of these two properties (auto-return and containment) the thing your aunt gave you provides an alternate solution of one of the puzzles in the game."
	  "It's a puzzle toward the very end of the game."
	  "It's the puzzle of getting the flowerpot out of the whale.">
	 <LTABLE 3
	  "Is the Hitchhiker's Guide important?"
	  "Well, the game IS named after it..."
	  "The various entries in the Guide contain all sorts of useful information and hints that you'll need to solve the puzzles in the game."
	  "The proper syntax for reading a particular Guide entry is CONSULT GUIDE ABOUT (item). For example, you could type CONSULT GUIDE ABOUT MUSHROOMS."
	  "Once you know the solutions to all the puzzles, you could play to the end of the game without ever using the Guide."
	  "There are 39 Guide entries in the game. A complete list of the topics appears in the MISCELLANEOUS section.">
	 <LTABLE 3
	  "How does the Thumb work?"
	  "The Thumb is an electronic Sub-Etha Auto-Hitching Device. If used properly, it will allow you to hitch rides aboard passing spaceships."
	  "You should read the Guide entry on the Thumb."
	  "You can examine the Thumb to determine whether a spaceship is within range. (If the lights are flashing, a ship is nearby.)"
	  "If a ship is within range, you can transport yourself to the ship (via a matter transference beam) by pushing the green button."
	  "If you press the green button when there is no ship around, you'll break the Thumb."
	  "Also, the Thumb will break down on its own over the course of the game."
	  "If the Thumb is broken, you will not be transported when you press the green button, even if a ship is nearby."
	  "A broken Thumb can be mended."
	  "To do so, push the red button to summon a repair robot. See the following question for further details on repairing the Thumb."
	  "There are three points in the game when you can use the Thumb."
	  "The first is near the beginning of the game, when you use it to get to the Vogon ship."
	  "The second is in the Airlock of the Vogon ship. It isn't necessary to use the Thumb here, because simply waiting a few turns has the same result."
	  "The third is Inside the Sperm Whale. Once again, there's an alternative to using the Thumb, but in this case it's not as simple as just waiting. See the INSIDE THE WHALE section for more information.">
	 <LTABLE 3
	  "How do I fix the thumb?"
	  "You can't. Only the Engineer robot can fix the Thumb."
	  "Once you've summoned the Engineer robot, SHOW (or GIVE) THE THUMB TO THE ENGINEER ROBOT."
	  "If the robot claims that there's nothing wrong with the Thumb, then it wasn't broken."
	  "If the Thumb is broken, the Engineer robot won't agree to fix it unless you also SHOW THE GUARANTEE TO THE ENGINEER ROBOT."
	  "Actually, you can shortcut by showing the guarantee first.">

	  "What's this nonsense about fluff?"
	  "There does seem to be a lot of it scattered throughout the game."
	  "Have you consulted the Guide about fluff?"

	  "There are a total of four pieces of fluff in the game. You'll have to find and obtain all four."
	  "Try finding them yourself. When you're stumped, return to this question."
	  "Hint: You have four different roles over the course of the game: Arthur, Ford, Trillian, and Zaphod."
	  "You can obtain one piece of fluff during each role."
	  "A list of all four fluff, and their locations, follows. You shouldn't look at this list unless you're completely stumped, because it will give away a lot."
	  "Pocket fluff: in the pocket of your gown at the start of the game. Satchel fluff: inside Ford's satchel (see EARTH, REVISITED). Jacket fluff: on Arthur's jacket (see AT THE PARTY). Seat cushion fluff: under the pilot seat of the speedboat (see ON DAMOGRAN)."
	  "Now that you have all four pieces of fluff, any idea what to do with them?"
	  "Don't continue until you have the flowerpot."
	  "You should plant each piece of fluff in the flowerpot."
	  "Now wait."
	  "A tiny plant will sprout around ten moves later."
	  "For more information, see the next question.">

	  "What do I do about the plant?"
	  "Left to itself, the tiny sprout will never grow any further."
	  "You have nothing to water the plant with."

	  "Notice that this rare plant once grew on a tropical world."
	  "Can you think of anything around that's similar to a tropical environment?"
	  "Carry the plant into the sauna."

Hypersonic pliers: in the Engine Room. Thermo-fusion chisel: in Marvin's Pantry. Laser-assisted monkey wrench: inside the toolbox on the speedboat. Ultra-plasmic vacuum awl: in the War Chamber.
